   <p>Right from the beginning opinions about JavaScript varied - some people love the language, others hate it. But there should be no doubt about the <strong>awesomeness of the community</strong> that made JavaScript one of the most popular programming languages.<br>In alignment to the <strong>free-and-open</strong> mindset of the community, JS.ORG made <strong>subdomains</strong> available for developers and their projects for free. Since this first step we also focused on tracking JavaScript <strong>trends</strong> and spreading <strong>news</strong> about it.</p>
